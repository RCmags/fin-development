# Development of Fin3 

Repository for the development of an improved fin tool for Garry's mod (Fin3). The original fin tool applies an aerodynamic force onto a prop with an unrealistic lift and drag model. This version aspires to correct the problem by using empirical models developed for airflow in real-life.
