Repository for the development of an improved version of the [Fin tool](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=165509582) for [Garry's mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/). The original fin tool applies an aerodynamic force onto a prop with an unrealistic lift and drag model. This version aspires to correct the problem by using empirical models developed for airflow in real-life.
